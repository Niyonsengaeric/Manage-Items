# Manage-Items

Manage items by adding new ones and the last entered item

## Project instruction

```

This file gives you a functioning app. But, as you can tell, the App
isn't modular at all - there is only 1 component!

**Task**: Break down this app into components and make them work together to achieve
exactly the same result.

Remember that React components should be modular, composable (can be assembled in various
ways to achieve the desired result on the page), and reusable.

This exercise will help you to practice passing data into components, creating
Stateless Functional Components, adding state to components, updating state, and
creating Controlled Components.

```
## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.
